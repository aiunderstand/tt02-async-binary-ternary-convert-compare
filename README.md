# Async Binary Ternary Converter Comparator
This chip offers various kinds of conversions and comparisons between binary encoded ternary and unary encoded ternary in both machine readible output and human readible (7-segment display decimal) output

## Features: 
- two channel binary encoded ternary to unary encoded ternary conversion
- one channel unary encoded ternary to binary encoded ternary conversion
- binary encoded ternary comparison of channel A and B
